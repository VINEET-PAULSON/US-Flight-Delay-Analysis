# US-Flight-Delay-Analysis
This project focuses on developing intuitive data dashboards through Tableau, using a Kaggle-derived dataset showcasing US Aviation data for 2018. This dataset encompasses diverse details about airports, airlines, cancellations, and delays. The main objective of these dashboards is to dissect airlines with prominent delay patterns and probe into the underlying causes. 

The dashboards boast interactivity, enabling users to employ dedicated filters, while also integrating Tableau Prep for data preprocessing and cleaning. This holistic approach, supplemented by visualizations of quantitative metrics such as linear regression and statistical indicators, aims to provide comprehensive analytical tools for stakeholders.
